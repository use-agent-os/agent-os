# Migration Guide

AgentOS can import state from OpenClaw and Hermes Agent into AgentOS
native files. The migration commands are designed to be previewed first, then
applied explicitly.

Supported migration paths:

- Auto-detect everything found under your home: `agentos migrate`
- OpenClaw -> AgentOS: `agentos migrate openclaw`
- Hermes Agent -> AgentOS: `agentos migrate hermes`

`agentos migrate` (with no subcommand) scans `~/.openclaw` and
`~/.hermes` and decides what to do based on what it finds:

- **Nothing detected**: prints the default paths it checked and exits 0.
- **Exactly one detected**: runs that migrator. No prompt, no flag needed.
- **Both detected, interactive (TTY) shell**: opens a multi-select prompt
  so you can pick one, both, or neither.
- **Both detected, non-interactive context (CI, piped, `--json`)**: prints
  the detected sources and exits 0 without migrating. Re-run with
  `--source openclaw,hermes` (or a subset) to opt in explicitly.

When both sources are selected, AgentOS runs OpenClaw first and Hermes
second. The second migrator sees whatever the first one wrote, so its
existing per-file dedupe / persona-conflict rules kick in normally. Use
`--source openclaw` or `--source hermes` (comma-separated) to narrow the
selection.

If you are running from a source checkout instead of an installed
`agentos` command, prefix the examples with `uv run`:

```sh
uv run agentos migrate openclaw --json
uv run agentos migrate hermes --json
```

## Before You Start

1. Stop any running AgentOS gateway if it is using the target home.
2. Make a manual backup of your AgentOS home if you need whole-home
   rollback. The migrators can back up overwritten items, but they do not yet
   create a complete pre-migration snapshot of `~/.agentos`.
3. Run a dry run first and inspect the report.
4. Do not pass `--migrate-secrets` until you have reviewed what will be copied.

Default locations:

- AgentOS home: `~/.agentos`
- OpenClaw source home: `~/.openclaw`
- Hermes Agent source home: `~/.hermes`

On Windows, these are under your user profile, for example
`C:\Users\<you>\.agentos`.

## Common Options

Both migration commands support the same main controls:

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--source PATH` | Source OpenClaw or Hermes Agent home. |
| `--config PATH` | AgentOS config path to preview or write. |
| `--apply` | Apply the migration. Without this, the command is a dry run. |
| `--migrate-secrets` | Copy recognized secrets such as API keys and channel tokens. Defaults to false. |
| `--overwrite` | Allow replacing existing targets. Existing overwritten items are backed up where supported. |
| `--preset user-data` | Migrate only user-facing data such as persona, memory, and skills. |
| `--preset full` | Migrate user data plus supported config/runtime artifacts. This is the default. |
| `--include IDS` | Include only selected migration option ids. Comma-separated. |
| `--exclude IDS` | Exclude selected migration option ids. Comma-separated. |
| `--skill-conflict MODE` | Handle imported skill name conflicts: `skip`, `overwrite`, or `rename`. |
| `--json` | Print a machine-readable report. Recommended for dry runs. |

## OpenClaw -> AgentOS

Use this path if your existing agent state is in an OpenClaw home.

Preview first:

```sh
agentos migrate openclaw --json
```

Preview a custom OpenClaw home:

```sh
agentos migrate openclaw --source /path/to/.openclaw --json
```

Apply without secrets:

```sh
agentos migrate openclaw --apply
```

Apply and copy recognized secrets:

```sh
agentos migrate openclaw --apply --migrate-secrets
```

Apply and rename imported skill conflicts instead of skipping them:

```sh
agentos migrate openclaw --apply --skill-conflict rename
```

### What Is Migrated From OpenClaw

AgentOS currently maps OpenClaw data into AgentOS-native locations:

- Workspace persona files such as `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `USER.md`.
- Long-term memory and daily memory where supported.
- User skills and shared skills, imported under `~/.agentos/skills/openclaw-imports/`.
- TTS assets, while unsupported TTS configuration is archived for review.
- Command allowlists.
- Model config, including string, object, and alias/catalog forms.
- Provider keys from `.env` or provider config when `--migrate-secrets` is set.
- MCP server definitions where AgentOS has native fields.
- Telegram, Discord, and Slack channel config where AgentOS has native channel support.
- Selected agent and tool settings with AgentOS-native equivalents.
- Unsupported or unsafe OpenClaw artifacts are archived for manual review.

The OpenClaw migrator also rewrites OpenClaw branding in migrated user-facing
workspace text to AgentOS branding and archives the original changed text
for review.

**Mixed-subject prose is kept verbatim.** When a workspace file (or a
single MEMORY.md block) already mentions `AgentOS` (any case), the
migrator skips the mechanical rebrand for that file/block and writes it
verbatim. Mechanical replacement of `OpenClaw` -> `AgentOS` in prose
that already names both runtimes as distinct entities produces factual
errors and self-referential nonsense. The report records
`details.rebrand_skipped: "mentions-agentos"` for the affected file
and, for MEMORY.md, `details.rebrand_skipped_block_count` so you can
reword the relevant lines by hand.

### SOUL.md / USER.md / AGENTS.md Conflict Handling

These persona files are identity definitions (not additive like memory), so
when the destination already holds real user-curated content the migrator
asks you which version to keep instead of either silently dropping the
imported content or clobbering the existing file.

Use ``--persona-conflict`` to control the behavior:

| Mode | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| ``prompt`` (default) | When stdin is a TTY: prompt for each conflicting file with a side-by-side preview and the four choices below. When stdin is not a TTY (CI, pipe, ``--json``): fall back to ``use-agentos`` and record a note so the choice is visible in the report. |
| ``use-agentos`` | Keep the destination file untouched. The OpenClaw original is copied to ``<output_dir>/archive/files/openclaw-orphaned/<filename>`` for review so nothing is silently lost. ``status: skipped``, ``details.persona_conflict_resolution: "use-agentos"``. |
| ``use-openclaw`` | Back up the destination to ``<name>.backup.<timestamp>`` and replace it with the OpenClaw content. ``status: migrated``, ``details.persona_conflict_resolution: "use-openclaw"``. |
| ``merge`` | Back up the destination and append the OpenClaw content below it under a ``## Imported from OpenClaw`` separator. Useful when the two versions are complementary rather than conflicting. ``status: migrated``, ``details.persona_conflict_resolution: "merge"``. |
| ``skip`` | Leave both files alone. The OpenClaw original is *not* archived — use ``use-agentos`` instead if you want a recoverable copy. ``status: skipped``, ``details.persona_conflict_resolution: "skip"``. |

``--overwrite`` short-circuits all of this and replaces the destination
wholesale (still with an item-level backup).

The pristine bootstrap-template case described below is handled before
``--persona-conflict`` and never asks for input: a freshly initialised
AgentOS workspace where the template is still untouched is treated as
overwrite-safe.

### MEMORY.md Merge Semantics

OpenClaw memory is additive by nature: every imported daily-memory file is
its own ``## Imported daily memory: <name>`` section. The OpenClaw migrator
therefore handles ``MEMORY.md`` differently from other workspace files: it
will never silently overwrite existing user-curated memory and it will
never silently drop the imported memory either.

Behaviour matrix (without ``--overwrite``):

| Destination state | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| ``MEMORY.md`` does not exist | Imported memory is written fresh. |
| Pristine AgentOS bootstrap template | Template is backed up, imported memory replaces it. ``details.replaced_bootstrap_template: true``. |
| Real user-curated content | Imported blocks that are not already present (after a whitespace-normalised, header-stripped comparison) are appended below the existing content. The pre-existing file is backed up first. ``details.appended_to_existing: true``, ``new_blocks_appended: N``, ``deduplicated_blocks_vs_existing: M``. |
| All imported blocks already present | The file is left untouched. ``status: skipped, reason: "all openclaw memory blocks already present in destination"``, ``details.deduplicated_against_existing: true``. No backup created. |

``--overwrite`` is the explicit "replace, do not merge" escape hatch — the
destination is backed up and replaced wholesale regardless of its current
contents.

### AgentOS Bootstrap-Template Handling

`ensure_agent_workspace` seeds placeholder ``SOUL.md`` / ``USER.md`` /
``AGENTS.md`` / ``MEMORY.md`` files when an AgentOS home is first
initialised. Without special handling those placeholders would block every
workspace-file migration with a silent ``conflict: target exists`` —
including the imported daily memory the user is migrating for in the first
place.

The OpenClaw migrator detects a destination that still holds the pristine
bootstrap template (byte-identical to the shipped placeholder after a
trailing-whitespace normalisation) and treats it as overwrite-safe:

- The pristine template is backed up to
  ``<name>.backup.<timestamp>`` next to the destination so the placeholder
  guidance can be recovered on demand.
- The imported content replaces the template.
- The migration report marks the item with
  ``details.replaced_bootstrap_template: true`` so the special case is
  visible rather than silent.

A destination file that the user has truly edited (i.e. no longer matches
the canonical template byte-for-byte) still gets the normal
``status: conflict`` treatment — only the pristine placeholder is treated
as overwrite-safe. To accept user edits being overwritten as well, pass
``--overwrite``.

### OpenClaw Limits

Some OpenClaw runtime behavior is not fully mapped yet:

- WhatsApp and Signal settings are detected, but AgentOS does not yet create
  native migrated channel entries for them.
- Some advanced MCP fields such as headers/auth/cwd/include/exclude are not
  native mapped.
- Some gateway, session, browser, approval, logging, plugin, cron, hook, memory
  backend, skills registry, and UI settings are archived rather than applied.
- AgentOS does not widen channel privileges: ordinary OpenClaw allowlists
  are not treated as AgentOS admin senders.

Review `MIGRATION_NOTES.md` after an applied migration for partial mappings and
manual follow-up.

## Hermes Agent -> AgentOS

Use this path if your existing agent state is in a Hermes Agent home.

Preview first:

```sh
agentos migrate hermes --json
```

Preview a custom Hermes Agent home:

```sh
agentos migrate hermes --source /path/to/.hermes --json
```

Preview a Hermes profile:

```sh
agentos migrate hermes --profile work --json
```

Apply without secrets:

```sh
agentos migrate hermes --apply
```

Apply and copy recognized secrets:

```sh
agentos migrate hermes --apply --migrate-secrets
```

Apply and rename imported skill conflicts instead of skipping them:

```sh
agentos migrate hermes --apply --skill-conflict rename
```

### What Is Migrated From Hermes Agent

AgentOS currently maps the common Hermes Agent home surface:

- Persona and user data files such as `SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and `USER.md`.
- Hermes skills, imported under `~/.agentos/skills/hermes-imports/`.
- Hermes model/provider config where there is an AgentOS-native equivalent.
- Hermes custom providers with `base_url`, mapped to OpenAI-compatible provider config.
- Environment values and recognized provider keys when `--migrate-secrets` is set.
- Search config where supported.
- MCP server definitions where supported.
- Telegram, Discord, and Slack channel tokens when `--migrate-secrets` is set.
- Selected plugin, cron, and unsupported runtime artifacts are archived for review.

### Hermes Agent Limits

The Hermes Agent migrator is newer than the OpenClaw migrator and has a smaller
coverage surface. Review the dry-run report carefully before applying.

Current limits:

- Live runtime state, active sessions, process state, and gateway state are not imported.
- Some Hermes runtime config option ids are accepted but currently deferred:
  `workspace-files`, `tools-config`, `browser-config`, `session-config`,
  `gateway-config`, `approvals-config`, `logging-config`, and `memory-backend`.
  Each appears in the migration report as `status: deferred` with reason
  `handler not implemented yet`. Selecting them via `--include` is not an
  error; the migrator just records the gap so it is visible.
- Browser, tool, session, gateway, approval, and logging settings may require manual review.
- A full pre-apply snapshot of `~/.agentos` is not created automatically.

### Hermes Agent Migration Behavior

The Hermes migrator now mirrors the OpenClaw migrator on a few correctness
behaviors that were previously documented but not implemented:

- **Item-level backups.** When `--overwrite` replaces an existing
  workspace file (`SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`) or skill directory, the
  prior contents are written to `<name>.backup.<timestamp>` next to the
  original before the new content is applied.
- **Semantic deduplication on merge.** Existing destination content is split
  into paragraph blocks and compared after whitespace normalization. A new
  source body is appended unless an equivalent block already exists. The
  previous naive substring check could silently drop short source bodies.
- **Memory overflow archival.** If the merged `MEMORY.md` would exceed
  AgentOS's per-file size limit, the overflow is split at a paragraph
  boundary and archived to
  `~/.agentos/migration/hermes/<timestamp>/archive/memory-overflow/MEMORY.overflow.md`.
  A short pointer is left at the end of `MEMORY.md`.
- **Branding rewrite.** Hermes branding in imported workspace prose
  (`SOUL.md`, `MEMORY.md`, `USER.md`) is rewritten to AgentOS. Bare
  `Hermes` is only rewritten when it is followed by a workspace-context word
  (e.g. `home`, `workspace`, `memory`, `config`). Source-reference tokens
  such as `HERMES_HOME`, `NousResearch`, and `hermes-agent` are preserved so
  the migration archive still points back at the original source. The
  unrebranded original is copied to
  `<output_dir>/archive/files/workspace-original/<name>.md` for review.
- **Path-token replacement is word-boundary aware.** Previously a plain
  string replace turned `~/.hermesrc` into `~/.agentosrc` and
  `.hermes_backup` into `.agentos_backup` — meaningless paths. The
  rebrand now only rewrites `.hermes` when it ends a path token (i.e.
  followed by `/`, whitespace, quote, or end-of-string). Same rule
  applied to `.openclaw` on the OpenClaw side, and bare-word
  `OpenClaw` / `openclaw` are now matched with `\b` so substrings like
  `OpenClawFlavored` or `openclaw_pid` are left alone.
- **Non-UTF-8 source files no longer crash.** Hand-edited source files
  with stray bad bytes (CP1252 fragments, leftover binary paste, etc.)
  used to abort the entire Hermes migration with
  `UnicodeDecodeError`. The source read now uses `errors="replace"`
  (matching OpenClaw); offending bytes become U+FFFD so users can spot
  them.
- **`mcp.enabled = false` is no longer silently flipped.** When the
  destination home already has MCP servers AND `mcp.enabled = false`
  (an explicit "I don't want MCP right now" choice), importing more
  MCP servers leaves the flag at `false` and surfaces
  `details.mcp_enabled_left_disabled` plus a `manual_steps` hint. MCP
  is still flipped on automatically when the destination had no
  servers (framework default — flipping is what the user wants).
- **Mixed-subject prose is kept verbatim.** Workspace notes often
  describe Hermes AND AgentOS as distinct entities ("Hermes Agent
  v0.13.0 installed at ~/.local/bin/hermes; AgentOS also installed
  at ~/.local/bin/agentos. Has `migrate hermes` subcommand."). A
  mechanical rebrand collapses the two subjects into one and produces
  factual errors (path mismatches), tautologies ("AgentOS skills
  loadable by AgentOS"), and self-referential commands ("migrate
  AgentOS skills to AgentOS"). When the source already
  mentions `AgentOS` (any case), the migrator now skips rebrand
  for that file and writes it verbatim, recording
  `details.rebrand_skipped: "mentions-agentos"` so you can decide
  which mentions to reword by hand. The same rule applies per-block
  during MEMORY.md merging; the count of skipped blocks is reported
  via `details.rebrand_skipped_block_count`.
- **Skill compatibility reporting.** Each imported skill's
  report record now includes `details.compatibility` (`loadable` /
  `needs_review` / `not_loadable`) and `details.compatibility_issues` listing
  missing frontmatter, oversize bodies, or invalid YAML. Skills are still
  copied; the field is informational so you can find ones that may need
  attention before activating.
- **Unknown providers are no longer written to `llm.provider`.** Hermes
  uses values like `auto` (runtime auto-detect) and may ship experimental
  providers (`bedrock`, `ollama`, ...) that have no AgentOS equivalent.
  Writing them verbatim used to crash `persist_config` because AgentOS
  validates `llm.provider` against a known set AND requires
  `agentos_router.tier_profile` to agree with it. The migrator now leaves
  `llm.provider` untouched in that case; the model id and base URL are
  still migrated, and the model-config item carries
  `details.unrecognized_provider`, `details.llm_provider_left_unchanged`,
  and a `manual_steps` hint explaining how to set the provider explicitly.
- **Known providers that clash with an existing
  `agentos_router.tier_profile` are also not written.** Even when the
  Hermes provider is recognized (e.g. `anthropic`), persisting it would
  fail if the destination home already pins `agentos_router.tier_profile`
  to a different provider (e.g. `openrouter`) — AgentOS requires the
  two to match. The migrator now detects the clash, leaves `llm.provider`
  unchanged, and records `details.tier_profile_conflict`,
  `details.llm_provider_left_unchanged`, and a `manual_steps` hint so you
  can switch providers explicitly via `agentos config set` or by
  clearing `agentos_router.tier_profile` first.
- **MCP server entries upsert instead of replacing.** Both migrators
  used to assign `cfg.mcp.servers = imported`, silently destroying any
  pre-existing AgentOS MCP servers the user already had configured.
  Now the imported servers are upserted by name: same-name entries are
  replaced (the imported version wins), unrelated entries are preserved.
  The `mcp-servers` report record carries `details.added`,
  `details.replaced`, and `details.preserved_existing`.
- **Resilient SKILL.md compatibility check.** A SKILL.md with empty or
  non-dict YAML frontmatter (e.g. `---\n\n---`) used to crash the whole
  migration with `AttributeError`. The check now records the skill as
  `compatibility: "not_loadable"` and continues. The reported
  `compatibility` string is also kept consistent with the
  `agentos_loadable` boolean.

## Reports

Use `--json` for dry-run automation:

```sh
agentos migrate openclaw --json
agentos migrate hermes --json
```

Applied migrations write report files under:

```text
~/.agentos/migration/openclaw/<timestamp>/
~/.agentos/migration/hermes/<timestamp>/
```

Typical files:

- `report.json`: structured item-level report.
- `summary.md`: human-readable count summary.
- `MIGRATION_NOTES.md`: OpenClaw migration notes when semantic conversions or
  partial mappings are present.
- `archive/`: unsupported or review-only artifacts.

Hermes dry runs also write report files. OpenClaw dry runs are best inspected
with `--json`; apply mode writes the report files.

## Validate After Migration

After applying a migration, start the gateway and run a small chat check:

```sh
agentos gateway start --json
agentos chat
```

Or use a one-shot prompt:

```sh
agentos agent -m "Briefly summarize your active persona and available memory."
```

Also check:

- `~/.agentos/workspace/` for migrated persona and memory files.
- `~/.agentos/skills/openclaw-imports/` or `~/.agentos/skills/hermes-imports/`.
- `~/.agentos/migration/<source>/<timestamp>/summary.md`.
- `~/.agentos/migration/<source>/<timestamp>/MIGRATION_NOTES.md` when present.

If behavior does not look right, stop the gateway, review the migration report,
and re-run with a narrower `--preset`, `--include`, or `--exclude` selection.

## Examples

Migrate only user data from OpenClaw:

```sh
agentos migrate openclaw --preset user-data --apply
```

Migrate only Hermes skills and persona files:

```sh
agentos migrate hermes --include soul,skills --apply
```

Preview OpenClaw migration while excluding channel settings:

```sh
agentos migrate openclaw --exclude telegram-settings,discord-settings,slack-settings --json
```

Apply Hermes migration to a custom config file:

```sh
agentos migrate hermes --config /path/to/agentos.toml --apply
```

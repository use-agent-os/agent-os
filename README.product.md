# AgentOS Product Guide

AgentOS is a token-efficient AI agent with on-device Pilot Router, for
the terminal, a local Web UI, and messaging channels. It is designed for users who want one
agent surface that can chat, use tools, remember useful context, run scheduled
work, publish artifacts, and route work across multiple LLM providers without
rewriting their workflow for each provider.

This guide is the product and usage entry point. The existing
[`README.md`](README.md) remains the package/release README.

## Start Here

1. Install AgentOS — follow the [Installation](README.md#installation) section
   of the README for the current release command. The newest release assets are
   always on the
   [Releases page](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/releases/latest).

2. Configure your provider:

   ```sh
   agentos onboard
   ```

3. Start the gateway:

   ```sh
   agentos gateway run
   ```

4. Open the control UI:

   <http://127.0.0.1:18791/control/>

For platform-specific install paths and recovery steps, see
[`docs/quickstart.md`](docs/quickstart.md).

## Why AgentOS

AgentOS focuses on cost-per-success and long-running usefulness rather than
single-turn chat alone.

| Product capability | What users get |
| --- | --- |
| Pilot Router | Local, on-device routing that chooses an appropriate model tier per turn so simple tasks avoid premium-model cost. |
| Tool compression | Large tool outputs stay useful without flooding the model context; raw results can be preserved while compact previews are sent to the model. |
| Unified surfaces | CLI, Web UI, gateway RPC, and channels share the same runtime path, tools, memory, approvals, and usage accounting. |
| Durable sessions | Conversations, transcripts, compaction summaries, artifacts, cost, and replay data are persisted for later inspection. |
| Personal memory | User facts, notes, and task traces can be saved and recalled through local keyword and semantic search. |
| Multi-provider runtime | OpenRouter (the default), the Bankr LLM Gateway, OpenCAP, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, DashScope, Ollama, and other provider-compatible backends can be configured through one schema. |
| Safe tool use | File, shell, web, memory, git, artifact, media, channel, and agent tools run behind policy layers and approval surfaces. |

## The Fastest Useful Workflow

After the gateway is running, use the surface that fits the job:

```sh
agentos chat
```

Use this for interactive terminal work.

```sh
agentos agent -m "Summarize this repo and tell me what to test"
```

Use this for one-shot automation.

```sh
agentos gateway start --json
```

Use this for background Web UI, channels, and RPC clients.

```sh
agentos sessions list
agentos cost
agentos doctor
```

Use these to inspect history, cost, and readiness.

## Configuration Essentials

AgentOS loads configuration in this order:

1. `AGENTOS_GATEWAY_CONFIG_PATH`
2. `./agentos.toml`
3. `~/.agentos/config.toml`
4. built-in defaults

Use the CLI for routine changes:

```sh
agentos onboard --if-needed
agentos configure provider --provider openrouter --api-key-env OPENROUTER_API_KEY
agentos configure router --router recommended
agentos configure search --search-provider brave --api-key-env BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY
agentos configure channels
agentos config get llm.provider
agentos config set gateway.port 18791
```

See [`docs/configuration.md`](docs/configuration.md) for details.

## Feature Highlights

### Pilot Router

Pilot Router is AgentOS's local routing layer. It keeps lightweight tasks
on cheaper models and reserves stronger tiers for harder turns. Router
decisions stay local; the user's prompt is not sent to a separate external
classifier just to decide the model.

Read: [`docs/features/agentos-router.md`](docs/features/agentos-router.md)

### Tool Compression

Agent work often creates huge tool results: logs, web pages, search results,
spreadsheets, diffs, and JSON. AgentOS can keep the raw result available
while projecting a compact model-visible preview, reducing context pressure
without throwing away the user's working state.

Read: [`docs/features/tool-compression.md`](docs/features/tool-compression.md)

## What AgentOS Can Do

- Run chat from Web UI, CLI, gateway RPC, terminal channels, and supported
  messaging platforms.
- Use tools for files, shell commands, code execution, git, web search/fetch,
  memory, sessions, artifacts, media, scheduled jobs, and subagents.
- Install, inspect, publish, and compose skills.
- Schedule recurring runs with `agentos cron`.
- Save durable memory and search previous sessions.
- Track usage and estimated cost with `agentos cost`.
- Diagnose readiness with `agentos doctor` and `/control/` health views.
- Export reproducible install state with `agentos dist`.
- Bridge AgentOS into MCP-capable clients with `agentos mcp-server run`
  when the `mcp` extra is installed.
- Create and deliver artifacts such as HTML files, PDF reports, slides,
  spreadsheets, generated images, and channel-delivered files.

## Safety Defaults

The gateway binds to `127.0.0.1` by default. Binding to public interfaces is
opt-in:

```sh
agentos gateway run --listen 0.0.0.0 --port 18791
```

Do not expose a public gateway without token auth and a network boundary you
trust. For tool behavior, approval flow, and workspace containment, see
[`docs/tools-and-sandbox.md`](docs/tools-and-sandbox.md).

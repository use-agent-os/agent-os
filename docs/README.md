## Improve These Docs

Documentation improvements are welcome. Start with
[`contributing-docs.md`](contributing-docs.md) for docs-specific guidance, then
open a small pull request against `main`.

Fast paths:

- Report a stale command, broken link, or confusing page with the
  [documentation issue template](https://github.com/use-agent-os/agent-os/issues/new?template=docs_report.yml).
- Edit the affected Markdown page on GitHub and open a focused pull request
  against `main`.
- For new feature documentation, keep independent features on independent pages
  under `docs/features/`.

## Design Principle

AgentOS documentation should help users run the product first, then
understand its special advantages. Mechanism-heavy runtime detail belongs in
developer design notes or source comments, not in the first-run path.

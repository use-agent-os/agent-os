# Tools, Approvals, and Sandbox

AgentOS tools give the agent useful capabilities. Policy layers, approval
surfaces, workspace constraints, and sandbox posture control how those tools are
allowed to act.

Use this page before running unattended automation, file edits, shell commands,
or channel-connected agents.

For a focused permissions guide, see
[`approvals-and-permissions.md`](approvals-and-permissions.md).

## Built-In Tool Areas

| Area | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Filesystem | `read_file`, `write_file`, `edit_file`, `list_dir`, `glob_search`, `grep_search`, spreadsheet reads. |
| Shell and code | `exec_command`, `background_process`, `process`, `execute_code`. |
| Git | `git_status`, `git_diff`, `git_log`, `git_commit`, `apply_patch`. |
| Web | `web_search`, `web_fetch`, `http_request`. |
| Memory | `memory_search`, `memory_save`, `memory_get`, `memory_delete`. |
| Sessions | `sessions_send`, `sessions_spawn`, `sessions_list`, `sessions_history`, `session_status`. |
| Artifacts | `publish_artifact`. |
| Media | image generation, PDF, TTS, and media helpers. |
| Skills | `skill_list`, `skill_view`, `skill_create`, `skill_edit`, `install_skill_deps`, `meta_invoke`. |
| Admin | cron and gateway administration. |
| Channels/platforms | messaging, chat, and media helpers across supported channel adapters. |

## Permission Modes

Use stricter modes when running unattended:

```sh
agentos agent --permissions restricted -m "Inspect this repo"
```

Use broader modes only when you trust the task and workspace:

```sh
agentos agent --permissions full --workspace /path/to/project -m "Run tests and fix failures"
```

For interactive work, the Web UI approvals surface can pause sensitive tool
calls for review. For automation, choose a permission mode and workspace policy
before the run starts.

## Approval Flow

Sensitive actions may pause for human approval depending on permission mode,
tool policy, channel surface, and runtime configuration.

Approvals are most important for:

- filesystem writes;
- shell commands;
- external channel or webhook delivery;
- generated artifacts that will be published;
- actions that affect another service.

Use the Web UI approvals page when you want durable review outside the chat
scrollback.

## Workspace Controls

Read-side restriction:

```sh
agentos agent --workspace /path/to/project --workspace-strict -m "Summarize this repo"
```

Write containment:

```sh
agentos agent \
  --workspace /path/to/project \
  --workspace-lockdown \
  --scratch-dir /path/to/project/.scratch \
  -m "Investigate and prepare a minimal patch"
```

`--workspace-lockdown` is intended for automation where writes must stay inside
the workspace or scratch directory.

## Sandbox Commands

```sh
agentos sandbox status
agentos sandbox on
agentos sandbox full
agentos sandbox bypass
agentos sandbox reset
```

Sandbox behavior is platform-dependent. Treat `sandbox status` and `doctor` as
the source of truth for the current machine.

## Recommended Patterns

| Task | Recommended posture |
| --- | --- |
| Read-only repo summary | `--workspace` plus `--workspace-strict` |
| Local patch with tests | `--workspace`, `--workspace-lockdown`, and a scratch dir |
| Chat with possible writes | Web UI with approvals visible |
| Channel-connected agent | Conservative permissions and explicit channel config |
| Provider/debug investigation | Diagnostics on, minimal tool permissions |

## Web Safety

AgentOS web tools use provider configuration and guardrails. Use provider
diagnostics when web search behaves unexpectedly:

```sh
agentos search status
agentos search query "test query"
agentos diagnostics on
```

Search results and fetched pages are external data. They should inform the
answer, not override tool policy or user instructions.

## Tool Compression

Large tool results may be compacted before they are shown to the model. This is
normal and protects the active context window. See
[`features/tool-compression.md`](features/tool-compression.md).

## Artifacts and Media

Tool calls can publish artifacts and generate media. See
[`artifacts-and-media.md`](artifacts-and-media.md) for user-facing artifact,
document, image, PDF, and TTS workflows.

## Troubleshooting

If a tool does not run:

1. Check permission posture:

   ```sh
   agentos sandbox status
   agentos doctor
   ```

2. Check whether the gateway or channel surface requires approval.
3. Confirm the workspace path is correct.
4. Use diagnostics for repeated failures:

   ```sh
   agentos diagnostics on
   ```

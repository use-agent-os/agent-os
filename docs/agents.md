# Durable Agents

AgentOS agents are named runtime profiles. Use them when different work
streams need different defaults, such as a research workspace, a writing
workspace, or a channel-facing assistant.

The built-in `main` agent is always available. Additional agents are configured
with `agentos agents`.

## When to Create an Agent

Create a durable agent when you want a stable identity for:

- a dedicated workspace;
- a default model choice;
- a separate channel or automation target;
- a recurring task profile;
- a specialized assistant name and description.

Do not create a new agent for every conversation. Use sessions for ordinary
conversation continuity.

## List Agents

```sh
agentos agents list
agentos agents list --json
```

## Add an Agent

```sh
agentos agents add research \
  --name Research \
  --description "Research and synthesis workspace" \
  --workspace /path/to/research \
  --model gpt-5.4-mini
```

Agent changes are written to configuration. Restart the gateway before relying
on the updated agent list:

```sh
agentos gateway restart
```

## Use an Agent With Sessions

Filter sessions by agent:

```sh
agentos sessions list --agent research
```

Create scheduled work for an agent:

```sh
agentos cron add \
  --agent research \
  --every 1h \
  --text "Summarize new research notes" \
  --name research-hourly-summary
```

Channel configuration can also route incoming messages to configured agents
depending on the channel setup.

## Delete an Agent

```sh
agentos agents delete research
agentos agents delete research --force
```

Deleting an agent entry leaves workspace files and state untouched. Clean those
up separately only when you are sure they are no longer needed.

## Agents vs Sessions vs Skills

| Concept | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| Agent | Durable identity and defaults for a work stream. |
| Session | Conversation history and active task continuity. |
| Skill | Reusable workflow instructions or tool routines. |

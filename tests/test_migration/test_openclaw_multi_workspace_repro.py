"""Repro: daily memory living in a sibling workspace (workspace-wN) is dropped.

Mirrors the real openclaw home layout we see in the wild, where openclaw.json
omits agents.defaults.workspace and the user actually has multiple sibling
workspace directories. The migrator currently only inspects the primary
workspace, so daily memory in any workspace-wN/memory/ is silently lost.

"""Tests for the CLI ``/file`` command.

The ``/file`` command:

  - Accepts the broader allow-list (PDF, text-family, JSON, plus images).
  - Routes by size: <= 2 MB inlines as base64 (same shape as /image today).
  - > 2 MB uploads to /api/v1/files/upload via the gateway bridge and
    references the returned ``file_uuid`` in the chat.send payload.
  - Hard-fails with a clear, actionable error when the bridge is
    unreachable AND the file exceeds the inline cap.

These tests target the helper directly so the contract is locked
without requiring a live gateway. The hooks the helper accepts (an
``upload_callable`` parameter) make it trivial to inject a fake
bridge in tests.

"""Byte-level ANSI sequence assertions for terminal writer collision detection.

These helpers pin the invariant that the concurrent chat REPL never emits a
malformed pairing of cursor, line-erase, or cursor-up sequences across the
combined stream, slash-handler, approval-suspend, and resume window.

The helpers here operate on raw byte streams (not Rich renderables) so
they catch the actual escape sequences the terminal would see, including
any sequences emitted directly by prompt-toolkit's renderer or by Rich's
Console under the hood.

Sequence reference:

  ``\\x1b[?25l``  hide cursor (DECRST 25)
  ``\\x1b[?25h``  show cursor (DECSET 25)
  ``\\x1b[2K``    erase entire line in current row
  ``\\x1b[<n>A``  move cursor up N rows

"""Slash-command classification table.

The concurrent REPL spawns each user input as a child turn task while the
input task keeps accepting keystrokes. When new input arrives mid-turn,
the policy split routes the command by category:

* ``DESTRUCTIVE`` (``/clear`` / ``/reset`` / ``/compact``) — purge the
  pending queue, cancel the active turn, then run synchronously.
* ``EXIT`` (``/exit`` / ``/quit``) — drain the pending queue then exit
  the loop (mirroring Ctrl-D semantics).
* ``PURE_INFO`` / ``STATE_MUTATION`` — both enqueue identically.
* ``NON_SLASH`` — runs as a normal turn.

These tests pin the classification surface so the runtime split in
``chat_cmd._run_concurrent_repl`` can rely on it.

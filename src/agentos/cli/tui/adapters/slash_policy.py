"""Slash-command classification for the concurrent chat REPL.

The concurrent REPL spawns each user input as a child turn task while the
input task keeps accepting keystrokes. When new input arrives mid-turn, the
policy split below decides whether the new command:

* **PURGES** the pending FIFO queue, cancels the current turn task, then
  runs immediately (``/clear``, ``/reset``, ``/compact``);
* **ENQUEUES** behind the current turn (state-mutation and pure-info
  commands) — both subclasses behave identically so the distinction is
  purely informational;
* **DRAINS** the pending queue and exits the loop (``/exit``, ``/quit``);
* runs as a non-slash turn through the normal flow.

The destructive and exit word sets are explicit frozensets to make the
behavior auditable; everything else is treated as enqueuable. Unknown
slash words (not in any of the explicit sets) are also treated as
enqueuable so the existing slash-handler chain can surface the canonical
"Unknown command. Use /help." notice synchronously inside the dispatch
without disturbing the in-flight turn.

The pure-info-vs-state-mutation distinction is internal taxonomy only:
both categories enqueue identically. Callers that need the finer split
(e.g., for future telemetry) can subset on the names below.

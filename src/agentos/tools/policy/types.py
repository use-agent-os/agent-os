"""Shared dataclasses and protocols for the policy pipeline.

A :class:`DispatchInput` carries every piece of state a :class:`PolicyCheck`
needs to make a decision. Checks return :class:`PolicyDecision` instances; an
allowing decision sets ``allowed=True`` with no envelope, while a denying
decision sets ``allowed=False`` and provides the :class:`ToolResult`
envelope plus an optional structured log event the orchestrator must emit.

    ----------

        The original :class:`ToolCall` requested by the agent loop.
    ctx:
        The effective :class:`ToolContext` (resolved from
        ``current_tool_context`` or the handler-build-time fallback).
    registered:
        The :class:`RegisteredTool` resolved from ``registry.get(...)``.
        Always present — registry-miss handling is performed by the
        orchestrator before the chain is consulted.
    registered_spec:
        Convenience alias for ``registered.spec`` to avoid attribute
        chains in the check bodies.
    registered_handler:
        Convenience alias for ``registered.handler``.
    known_skill_names:
        Frozen set of skill names recognised by the agent loop. Currently
        unused by the policy chain (the orchestrator handles the skill
        miss path), but threaded through so future checks can opt in.
    registry:
        The :class:`ToolRegistry` the handler was built from. Threaded
        through for completeness; currently unused by the chain.

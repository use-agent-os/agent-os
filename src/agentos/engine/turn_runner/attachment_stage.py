"""Stage object for the attachment-message build + ``turn_input`` rebind.

Owns the per-turn slice between the compaction/history stage boundary
and the stream-consumer stage boundary: the
``_build_attachment_messages`` call and the immediately-following
``turn_input`` rebind. The harness invokes ``AttachmentStage.run`` once
per turn, AFTER ``CompactionAndHistoryStage`` and BEFORE the
``async for event in agent.run_turn(...)`` loop.
Side-effect contract: the stage is a pure transformation. The single
port executes synchronously and has no observable side effects on the
agent / runner / session. Validation failures (count cap, disallowed
media type, ref-without-media-root, invalid base64, oversize) raise
``ValueError`` from the port and propagate as-is to the outer terminal
handler in ``_run_turn``. Per-attachment soft failures (missing ref
bytes, PDF parse failure, text-family decode failure) are absorbed
inside the build call into ``[attachment unavailable: …]`` placeholder
text blocks; the stage never sees them.

``AttachmentStage`` does NOT call any ``TurnHook`` or
``CompactionHook``. The slice has no observability emission today; the
stage preserves that.

NEVER terminates. Always returns ``StageOutcome.success(...)``. The
``StageOutcome`` shape is preserved for forward-compatibility with a
future ``ErrorEvent`` early-yield branch.

"""TurnContext — mutable accumulator owned by the TurnRunner harness.

Cross-cutting state threaded across ordered TurnRunner stages. Owned exclusively
by the harness; stage classes read it through typed StageInput dataclasses and
write it via StageOutput return values the harness applies.

Direct mutation of TurnContext from inside a stage is forbidden — a stage
that needs to mutate cross-cutting state returns it via its Output.

The dataclass starts with InputStage and ProviderAndToolsStage output fields and
can grow as later stages move behind the harness boundary.

Note: distinct from ``agentos.engine.pipeline.TurnContext`` which is
the pre-turn pipeline value object. The two coexist while the pipeline
TurnContext stays in place. Import this one as::

    from agentos.engine.turn_runner.context import TurnContext as HarnessTurnContext

when both names are needed in the same module.

"""Core sandbox value types.

This module defines the plain-data vocabulary the rest of the ``agentos.sandbox``
package works with: the security level enum, the shape of a network mode, the
mount specification, the assembled :class:`SandboxPolicy`, and the
request/result pair the backends consume and produce.

The types intentionally stay decoupled from the gateway settings model. A
settings object is translated into a :class:`SandboxPolicy` by
``agentos.sandbox.policy`` so that the policy object has no dependency on
Pydantic and can be constructed directly in unit tests.

``SandboxResult`` here is the *backend* outcome shape; it is distinct from the
``SandboxResult`` in :mod:`agentos.safety.sandbox`, which describes a resource-
limited subprocess run. The two types are composed (the noop backend and the
bubblewrap fallback path build a backend result from a safety-layer result),
never merged.

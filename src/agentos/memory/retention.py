    """Remove memory files older than ``ttl_days``. Returns counts.

    Args:
        memory_dir: Per-agent memory root (e.g. ``<workspace>/memory``).
        store: ``LongTermMemoryStore`` (anything with ``async remove_file``).
        ttl_days: 0 disables the sweep. Files with mtime older than
            ``now - ttl_days * 86400 - debounce_seconds`` are pruned.
        workspace_dir: Per-agent workspace root. Store keys are computed
            as ``path.relative_to(workspace_dir)`` to match the
            ``MemorySyncManager._scan_files`` convention. Defaults to
            ``memory_dir.parent`` since manager.py keeps the parent /
            child relationship in both ``source="workspace"`` and
            ``source="state"`` modes.
        exempt_files: Names that survive regardless of mtime. Default
            covers ``MEMORY.md`` + bootstrap files; pass a smaller set
            only if you know what you are doing.
        exempt_dot_prefix_dirs: If True (default), files under any
            dot-prefix subdirectory survive. Mirrors ``sync_manager._scan_files`` rule.
        cap_per_sweep: Max files to delete in one call. Bounds the
            blast radius of the first restart sweep when files have
            accumulated. Subsequent sweeps pick up the rest.
        debounce_seconds: Margin subtracted from the cutoff so files
            written within the last ``debounce_seconds`` are never
            pruned. Matches ``MemorySyncManager`` watcher debounce so a
            file just written by ``TurnCaptureService`` cannot race
            into the sweep.

    Returns:
        ``PruneResult`` with examined / pruned / chunks_removed counts
        and a ``capped`` flag if the cap was hit.

    Concurrency:
        - Tolerates ``FileNotFoundError`` on both ``stat()`` and
          ``unlink()`` so a parallel sweeper unlink does not crash this call.
        - ``store.remove_file`` failures are logged and swallowed; the
          watcher's next tick will re-discover and clean any stale
          chunk left behind.

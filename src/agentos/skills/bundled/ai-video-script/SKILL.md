# ai-video-script — structured short-video script generator

Turns a topic/keyword + style + duration into a strict-format shooting script
the downstream `nano-banana-pro` and `seedance-2-prompt` skills can parse
without ambiguity. The default emits 3 shots; the caller may ask for 4 or 5.

## Inputs

Free-text via `with.task` / `with.request`:
- Topic / product / story
- Target audience (optional)
- Style (轻松/专业/故事/科普/带货) — narrative style, not render style
- Total duration (15s, 30s, 60s default)
- Aspect ratio (9:16 default, 16:9 optional)
- `N_SHOTS` override (5 default, **1-10 allowed**)

Caller-supplied anchors (used verbatim — this skill never invents them):
- `with.render_style` — one-line aesthetic the per-shot prompts must end
  with. Examples: `2D anime illustration, flat colour, soft cel-shading`,
  `watercolour storybook illustration`, `cinematic photoreal 35mm grain`.
  If absent / empty, emit the literal sentinel `(render style missing)`
  into the RENDER_STYLE field so downstream parsers can fail loudly.
- `with.identity_anchor` — one-line description of the main character(s)
  that every shot must reproduce byte-for-byte. Example: `Lin, a
  25-year-old East Asian woman with chin-length black bob, almond eyes,
  wearing sage-green oversized knit sweater and gold round earrings`. If
  absent / empty, emit the literal sentinel `(identity anchor missing)`
  so callers can detect the gap before spending on image/video gen.

This skill does **not** choose render style or character identity; the
orchestrator (or its user_input clarify step) does. This separation lets
the same skill serve product ads (no human) and short dramas (with
locked characters) without baked-in defaults.

## Output format (STRICT — orchestrators parse this)

Always emit exactly these top-level blocks, in this order:

```
=== OVERVIEW ===
TITLE: <one line>
DURATION_S: <int>
ASPECT_RATIO: <9:16|16:9>
STYLE: <one line>
AUDIENCE: <one line>
N_SHOTS: <int 3-5>
IDENTITY_ANCHOR: <copied verbatim from with.identity_anchor, or "(identity anchor missing)">
RENDER_STYLE: <copied verbatim from with.render_style, or "(render style missing)">

=== SHOT_1 ===
DURATION_S: <int 3-6>
CAMERA: <wide|medium|close-up + push/pull/pan/tilt/static>
IMAGE_PROMPT: <IDENTITY_ANCHOR verbatim>, <scene/action>, <RENDER_STYLE verbatim>, --ar 9:16
VIDEO_PROMPT: <IDENTITY_ANCHOR verbatim>, <one major action + camera move + duration hint>, <dialogue/voiceover/sound tags derived from VOICEOVER — see rule 11>, <RENDER_STYLE verbatim>, aspect_ratio: 9:16, no watermark, no logo, no subtitles
VOICEOVER: <one line, max 20 Chinese chars or 30 English words — kept verbatim for SRT subtitle burn-in>
ON_SCREEN_TEXT: <one short line or empty>

=== SHOT_2 ===
... (same fields, IMAGE_PROMPT and VIDEO_PROMPT must begin with the
exact same IDENTITY_ANCHOR bytes as SHOT_1)

=== SHOT_3 ===
... (same fields)
```

For any `N_SHOTS` between 1 and 10, emit exactly that many
`=== SHOT_K ===` blocks numbered 1..N_SHOTS, each with the same fields.
Do not emit shot blocks beyond `N_SHOTS`. Never skip a field; use the
literal value `none` for empty `ON_SCREEN_TEXT`.

`N_SHOTS` semantics:
- 1: a single hero shot (5-10s typical) — product/landscape vignette.
- 2-3: classic short-form story arc.
- 4-6: extended narrative with multiple beats; good for 45-60s drama.
- 7-10: stretched-form drama; total duration grows linearly with cost.

## Rules

1. **Identity continuity** — `with.identity_anchor` is pasted byte-for-byte
   at the start of every shot's IMAGE_PROMPT and VIDEO_PROMPT. Do not
   paraphrase, summarize, or pronoun-substitute it. If shot 3's anchor
   text differs by one comma from shot 1's, you wrote it wrong.
2. **Visual concreteness** — replace abstract verbs with observable action:
   "a young woman in a red trench coat walks through rain-soaked neon
   streets" >> "a woman walking".
3. **IP-safe** — do not use franchise names, character names, brand terms,
   or "style of" references. Invent original names if needed.
4. **No multi-line values** — IMAGE_PROMPT, VIDEO_PROMPT, VOICEOVER,
   ON_SCREEN_TEXT must each be a single line.
5. **Aspect ratio explicit** — every IMAGE_PROMPT ends with the literal
   token `--ar 9:16` (or `--ar 16:9`); every VIDEO_PROMPT ends with the
   literal token `aspect_ratio: 9:16` (or 16:9).
6. **Duration math** — `sum(SHOT_i.DURATION_S) == OVERVIEW.DURATION_S` ±2s.
7. **Voiceover length** — total voiceover should be speakable in
   `DURATION_S` seconds (~3 Chinese chars/sec, ~2 English words/sec).
8. **Match the user's language** — write **all** fields (TITLE, STYLE,
   AUDIENCE, IDENTITY_ANCHOR, RENDER_STYLE, IMAGE_PROMPT, VIDEO_PROMPT,
   VOICEOVER, ON_SCREEN_TEXT) in the **same language the user wrote in**.
   - The current downstream image/video models — `google/gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`
     and `bytedance/seedance-2.0` — both accept Chinese natively.
     Seedance (ByteDance) is in fact a Chinese-first model and tends to
     produce **more on-topic results** with Chinese prompts when the
     story itself is Chinese (e.g. 咖啡店偶遇 / 国风武侠 / 校园回忆).
   - Do **not** translate the user's Chinese topic into English just to
     fill IMAGE_PROMPT — that loses cultural detail and often hallucinates
     a Western-coded substitute.
   - Mixed-language input (English topic + Chinese voiceover note,
     vice-versa) → the *bulk* of prompts follow whichever language the
     **topic/story** is in; localised fields like VOICEOVER may follow
     the language explicitly named by the user.
   - English remains valid: pick it when the user wrote in English, or
     when the user explicitly asked for English prompts.
9. **Plain text only — no emoji, no decorative symbols.** The script
   flows through Python subprocesses on Windows consoles whose default
   code page (cp936/GBK) cannot encode `✅`, `❌`, `✨`, `🎬`, or any
   non-BMP character. The orchestrator will crash with a
   `UnicodeEncodeError` if any field contains one. Use plain CJK + ASCII
   only. Do not "decorate" changed lines with checkmarks even when
   re-drafting.
10. **Style-tag exception** — RENDER_STYLE is a label, not a sentence.
   It's fine to keep canonical aesthetic tags in their native vocabulary:
   `2D anime illustration` and `水墨风, monochrome with one accent` are
   both valid; mixed-language tags like `水墨风 ink-wash, paper texture`
   also work. Whichever form the caller passes in via `with.render_style`
   is copied verbatim.
11. **VOICEOVER must also appear inside VIDEO_PROMPT as a dialogue/
    voiceover tag** — Seedance 2.0 natively generates audio AND lip-sync
    when given explicit dialogue cues in the prompt (see the upstream
    JiMeng "Short Drama with Dialogue" recipe). Without the tag,
    seedance produces silent video and the spoken line only appears
    via burned-in subtitles (no audio track). With the tag, seedance
    also generates the actual spoken audio, the speaker's mouth moves
    correctly, and the burned subtitle is reinforced by real sound.

    Choose ONE of these tag forms per shot, in this order:

    a. **Character dialogue** (the VOICEOVER reads as a character's
       quoted line — surrounded by quotes or paired with a name like
       "陆冷笑一声:'...'" / "Lu sneers, '...'"):

         Dialogue (<CharacterName from IDENTITY_ANCHOR>, <emotion>): "<the line>"

       Examples (placed inline in VIDEO_PROMPT after the action / camera
       segment, before RENDER_STYLE):
         Dialogue (Zhang, furious): "Take your internship report and get out of my company right now!"
         Dialogue (张, 愤怒): "拿着你的实习报告,立刻给我滚出公司!"
         Dialogue (Lu, sneering): "Are you sure you want to fire me, Manager Zhang?"

    b. **Narration / inner monologue** (VOICEOVER reads as a faceless
       narrator's line, no on-screen speaker, no quotes):

         Voiceover (narrator, <emotion>): "<the line>"

       Example:
         Voiceover (narrator, wistful): "推开那扇熟悉的咖啡店门。"

    c. **No voice this shot** (VOICEOVER is the literal value `none` /
       empty) — emit no dialogue tag at all in VIDEO_PROMPT. Optionally
       still add a `Sound: <ambient cue>` tag if a specific sound effect
       defines the shot.

    Additional rules for the tag:
      - The emotion label is one short adjective (calm / sad / excited
        / sneering / furious / panicked / 冷峻 / 愤怒 / 惊恐 / 平静).
        Seedance uses it to shape vocal prosody.
      - CharacterName MUST match a name token used in IDENTITY_ANCHOR
        (Zhang / 张 / Lin / 林 etc.) so seedance knows whose mouth to
        animate. Do not invent new names.
      - The "<the line>" inside the quotes is the SAME LANGUAGE as the
        VOICEOVER field. Do not translate. Keep punctuation; use ASCII
        single quotes inside dialogue if you need a quote-within-quote.
      - Negative constraint `no subtitles` STAYS in VIDEO_PROMPT —
        that's about not rendering subtitle bars inside the seedance
        video frame. The dialogue tag controls AUDIO; the subtitle bar
        is burned in by a downstream ffmpeg step from the VOICEOVER
        field.
      - Multiple speakers in one shot: chain tags with semicolons:
          Dialogue (Lu, sneering): "..." ; Dialogue (Zhang, panicked): "..."

12. **VIDEO_PROMPT length budget** — with the dialogue tag added, the
    practical ceiling is ≤500 chars per VIDEO_PROMPT. IMAGE_PROMPT
    stays at ≤220 chars. The downstream extract step in meta-short-
    drama truncates at 700 chars (after appending the Assets Mapping
    preamble), so individual VIDEO_PROMPTs that overshoot get clipped
    at the END — keep the dialogue tag BEFORE the RENDER_STYLE
    repetition so it survives truncation.

## Style presets (only adjust IMAGE_PROMPT/VIDEO_PROMPT modifiers)

- **商业 / Commercial**: "studio lighting, hero product shot, clean
  background, shallow depth of field"
- **故事 / Story**: "cinematic, soft natural light, 35mm film grain,
  shallow depth of field"
- **科普 / Educational**: "isometric infographic style, flat colour,
  bright key light, clean composition"
- **带货 / E-commerce**: "high-key lighting, white seamless background,
  product 360 spin"
- **轻松 / Casual**: "bright daylight, handheld feel, vibrant colours"

## Negative defaults (always add to VIDEO_PROMPT)

`no watermark, no logo, no subtitles, no on-screen text outside ON_SCREEN_TEXT.`

## Example A — Chinese request, all-Chinese script (50s, 5 shots, 9:16)

User wrote the request in Chinese, so every field is Chinese — including
IMAGE_PROMPT and VIDEO_PROMPT. Seedance 2.0 and Gemini 3.1 image both
handle these prompts natively. Note the RENDER_STYLE is photoreal
cinematic (an opt-in style — downstream seedance moderation MAY refuse
photoreal human faces; the meta-skill's video step retries twice then
falls back to a Ken-Burns clip if the model persistently refuses).

```

Notes on what makes these examples work:

- **IDENTITY_ANCHOR is the first comma-separated segment of every
  IMAGE_PROMPT and VIDEO_PROMPT**, byte-identical across all five
  shots. RENDER_STYLE sits near the end of each prompt, also repeated
  verbatim. That repetition is what gives the video model a stable
  identity + style anchor.
- Shots 2 and 4 deliberately drop the second character from the
  IDENTITY_ANCHOR fragment — only the character actually on-camera is
  named. The anchor "vocabulary" stays consistent (same name, same
  age/clothing string) but you may omit the off-camera person to keep
  the prompt focused.
- Each VIDEO_PROMPT carries ONE major action + ONE camera move per
  10-second beat. Trying to pack multiple beats into a single shot
  blurs the result.
- ON_SCREEN_TEXT is short (4 CJK chars or 2-3 English words) — long
  enough to read at 10 fps but short enough not to compete with the
  voiceover or main subject.
- VOICEOVER quotes punctuation goes verbatim into the SRT later; punctuation
  marks survive UTF-8 round-trip through ai-video-script → srt-from-script
  → subtitle-burner.

## What this skill does NOT do

- Does not call any image/video API itself — it only emits text.
- Does not invent SHOT durations that violate `OVERVIEW.DURATION_S`.
- Does not produce more than 10 shots in a single pass.

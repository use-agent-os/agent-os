# AgentOS Memory

Use only tools that are visible in the current tool list. This skill explains
AgentOS's memory source files; it does not make hidden tools available.

## Source Files

- `USER.md`: stable user profile fields such as name, preferred address,
  pronouns, timezone, and durable profile notes. Edit it with visible
  filesystem tools, not `memory_save`.
- `MEMORY.md`: curated long-term non-profile facts, preferences, decisions,
  and constraints.
- `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` and `memory/**/*.md`: daily, session, or named memory
  notes.
- `turns/**/*.md`: private auto-captured turn state. These files are for
  audit/future processing and are not indexed or returned by ordinary
  `memory_search`.

The Markdown files are the source of truth. The memory index/database is derived
from curated `MEMORY.md` and `memory/**/*.md` files only.

## Recall

- Use injected `USER.md` first for current user identity/profile questions.
- Use `memory_search` for historical or non-profile recall that is not already
  in injected context.
- Use `memory_get` after search when exact lines or more context are needed.

## Remember Or Update

- If the user specifies a memory path, use that exact path if it is a valid
  memory source file.
- For profile facts, edit `USER.md` with visible filesystem tools.
- For daily or session notes, write to `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or another
  appropriate `memory/**/*.md` source.
- For curated long-term facts in `MEMORY.md`, read the current file first and
  write the full updated content. If `memory_save` is available, use
  `mode='replace'` for `MEMORY.md`; do not append to it.
- If `memory_save` is available, use it only for `MEMORY.md` or
  `memory/**/*.md`, never for `USER.md`.
- If `memory_save` is not available but filesystem tools are visible, edit or
  create the same source files directly.

## Forget Or Correct

- Search first, then read the relevant file/lines before removing anything.
- If `memory_delete` is available, use it only when the user wants to delete a
  whole memory source file.
- To remove or correct one fact, edit the source file directly when filesystem
  tools are visible.
- If no write or delete tool is available, report the exact path and lines that
  should be changed instead of claiming the memory was updated.

## Boundaries

- Do not store ordinary deliverables such as reports, JSON outputs, or result
  files in memory source files.
- Do not save secrets, tokens, private keys, or full credential contents.
- Only confirm memory was updated after the write or delete succeeds.

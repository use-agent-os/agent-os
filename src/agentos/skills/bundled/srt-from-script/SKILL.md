# srt-from-script

Parses an ai-video-script 3-shot script and writes an SRT subtitle file
whose cues track the script's VOICEOVER per shot, time-coded with
cumulative shot durations.

## Inputs (`with:`)

| key | required | default | notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `script` | yes | — | Full script text (the entire OUTPUT FORMAT block, including OVERVIEW + SHOT_1..N). Passed via stdin so the orchestrator does not need to write a temp file. |
| `output_path` | yes | — | Output `.srt` path. Parent dir created if missing. |
| `gap_ms` | no | `200` | Tail pad subtracted from each cue's end so the subtitle vanishes ~200 ms before the next shot starts — avoids cuts clipping mid-character. |
| `leading_offset_ms` | no | `0` | Shifts every cue forward by this many ms. Set to the cover/intro clip duration when the merged video prepends a title card before SHOT_1. |

## Parsing rules

- A shot with `VOICEOVER: none` or empty contributes no SRT cue but its
  `DURATION_S` still advances the timeline cursor.
- Cue language follows the script verbatim. Chinese stays Chinese,
  English stays English — no translation.
- Cumulative timestamps: SHOT_1 starts at 00:00:00,000; SHOT_2 starts at
  SHOT_1.duration; etc.
- End time of each cue = next-shot start − `gap_ms`, clamped to ≥ 800 ms
  after start so very short voiceover lines remain readable.

## Output

Prints the absolute path of the written `.srt` on stdout.
The file is UTF-8 encoded so CJK voiceover lines survive when ffmpeg
reads them via the `subtitles=` filter.

## Limits

- Assumes the script follows ai-video-script's strict OUTPUT FORMAT
  (`=== SHOT_N ===` blocks with `DURATION_S:` and `VOICEOVER:` fields).
  Drift away from that format → zero cues, exit 1.
- 3-5 shots tested. Larger shot counts work but timestamps grow.

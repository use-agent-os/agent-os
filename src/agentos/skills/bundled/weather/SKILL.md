# Weather Skill

Get current weather conditions and forecasts.

## Meta-Skill Entrypoint

Meta-skills can run this skill as `skill_exec` for a bounded JSON forecast
without spawning an LLM sub-agent. The entrypoint extracts `DESTINATION:` from
planner contracts, queries wttr.in, and returns compact `current`, `forecast`,
`seasonal_hint`, and `errors` fields. Network failures are reported in
`errors` while preserving a usable seasonal hint.

## Location

Always include a city, region, or airport code in weather queries.

## Commands

### Current Weather

```bash
# One-line summary
curl "https://wttr.in/London?format=3"

# Detailed current conditions
curl "https://wttr.in/London?0"

# Specific city
curl "https://wttr.in/New+York?format=3"
```

### Forecasts

```bash
# 3-day forecast
curl "https://wttr.in/London"

# Week forecast
curl "https://wttr.in/London?format=v2"

# Specific day (0=today, 1=tomorrow, 2=day after)
curl "https://wttr.in/London?1"
```

### Format Options

```bash
# One-liner
curl "https://wttr.in/London?format=%l:+%c+%t+%w"

# JSON output
curl "https://wttr.in/London?format=j1"

# PNG image
curl "https://wttr.in/London.png"
```

### Format Codes

- `%c` — Weather condition emoji
- `%t` — Temperature
- `%f` — "Feels like"
- `%w` — Wind
- `%h` — Humidity
- `%p` — Precipitation
- `%l` — Location

```

## Notes

- No API key needed (uses wttr.in)
- Rate limited; don't spam requests
- Works for most global cities

    The `strategy` argument selects which ranking sources contribute:
    "lexical" runs FTS only and never touches the embedder; "semantic"
    runs cosine ranking only when an embedder is available, and falls
    back to lexical-only when the local embedding backend is unavailable
    (per spec §5.1 — silent degradation is preferred over an empty skill
    set for the turn); "hybrid" runs both and fuses via RRF.

    Indexes are rebuilt automatically when the input skill set changes
    (fingerprinted by skill id tuple). Retrievals never raise; if the
    semantic path is unavailable (embedding backend missing or model
    load failure), the retriever degrades to lexical-only and stays
    that way for the rest of the process lifetime."""
